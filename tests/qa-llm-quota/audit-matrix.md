# LLM Provider × SKU Quota Audit — 2026-05-13

**Trigger**: `python-prod.log` reports all 4 providers exhausted on default SKUs

```
[llm_router] All providers exhausted for chat:
  aliyun_b/qwen3.6-flash 403 (FreeTierOnly exhausted)
  aliyun_a/qwen3.5-plus ReadTimeout
  zhipu/glm-4-plus 429 余额不足或无可用资源包
  deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash 402 Insufficient Balance
```

**Method**: Live `chat/completions` test calls with `max_tokens=5`, 25s timeout, recorded HTTP status.
**Audit script**: `/tmp/audit-llm.sh` + `/tmp/audit-llm-2.sh` (May 13 2026)
**Tested with prod API keys** sourced from `scripts/systemd/restart-test.sh.new`.

## Audit Matrix

### aliyun_b (account B — historically free-quota mine)

| SKU | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3.6-flash` | **403 EXHAUSTED** | free tier 用完, was SLOT.CHAT/INSIGHTS primary — TRIGGERED PROD INCIDENT |
| `qwen-flash` | **200 OK** | working — recommended new primary for CHAT/INSIGHTS |
| `qwen3.5-flash` | 403 EXHAUSTED | free tier 用完 |
| `qwen-plus` | 403 EXHAUSTED | free tier 用完 |
| `qwen-turbo` | **200 OK** | working — current SLOT.MAPPER primary, still OK |
| `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | **200 OK** | working — additional MAPPER fallback candidate |
| `glm-5` | **200 OK** | working — current CHART primary, still OK |
| `deepseek-r1` | **200 OK** | working — current REASONING primary, still OK |
| `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | **200 OK** | working — current REVIEW primary, still OK |
| `qwen-vl-plus-2025-05-07` | **200 OK** | working — current VL primary, still OK |

### aliyun_a (account A)

| SKU | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen3.5-plus-2026-04-20` | **200 OK** | **STILL WORKING** — log "ReadTimeout" was transient (current CHAT primary) |
| `qwen3.6-flash-2026-04-16` | 403 EXHAUSTED | free tier 用完 (current INSIGHTS primary on A — broken!) |
| `qwen-flash` | **200 OK** | working on A too (memory said paid — re-check; may be free now) |
| `qwen3.5-plus` | **200 OK** | working (bare alias) |
| `qwen3.5-122b-a10b` | **200 OK** | working — current MAPPER primary |
| `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` | **200 OK** | working — current REASONING/REVIEW primary |
| `glm-5` | **200 OK** | working — current CHART primary |
| `qwen3-vl-flash` | 403 EXHAUSTED | free tier 用完 (current VL secondary on A — broken!) |
| `qwen3.5-flash` | **200 OK** | working — INSIGHTS fallback candidate |

### zhipu (ZhipuAI)

| SKU | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `glm-4-plus` | **429 EXHAUSTED** | 余额不足/无可用资源包 — TRIGGERED PROD INCIDENT |
| `glm-4-flash` | **200 OK** | working — recommended new primary for CHAT/INSIGHTS |
| `glm-4-air` | 429 EXHAUSTED | 余额不足 |
| `glm-4.5-air` | **200 OK** | working — current CHART/MAPPER/REASONING/REVIEW primary |
| `glm-3-turbo` | 429 EXHAUSTED | 余额不足 |
| `glm-4` | 429 EXHAUSTED | 余额不足 |
| `glm-4-flashx`, `glm-4-airx`, `glm-4-long`, `glm-4v`, `glm-4v-plus` | 429 | all 余额不足 |

### deepseek (DeepSeek official — paid only)

| SKU | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-v4-flash` | **402 BALANCE 0** | Insufficient Balance — paid only, recharge needed |
| `deepseek-chat` | 402 BALANCE 0 | same — recharge needed |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | 402 BALANCE 0 | same — recharge needed |

DeepSeek-official has no free tier; account balance must be recharged. **Until then, deepseek tail provider effectively unusable** but `_is_quota_exhausted` only matches 403/429 — **402 will trigger the "non-quota error" path** which still falls through to next provider, so chain remains correct. The deepseek slots are effectively a no-op until recharge.

## SKU Changes per SLOT

Primary recovery: swap exhausted primaries to confirmed-working SKUs. Keep old SKU as fallback in fallback chain (chain order: `aliyun_b → aliyun_a → zhipu → deepseek`). Note: `SLOT_MODELS` is a per-account dict, so "fallback" within a single provider is not natively supported — when primary on B exhausts, the chain moves to A automatically. The pertinent change is **which SKU each provider tries first**.

| SLOT | Account | Before | After | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAT | aliyun_b | `qwen3.6-flash` 403 | **`qwen-flash`** 200 | unblock incident root cause |
| CHAT | aliyun_a | `qwen3.5-plus-2026-04-20` (ReadTimeout in log, but 200 now) | **unchanged** — transient | log timeout was network blip, SKU works |
| CHAT | zhipu | `glm-4-plus` 429 | **`glm-4-flash`** 200 | unblock incident root cause |
| CHAT | deepseek | `deepseek-v4-flash` 402 | **unchanged** — entire account exhausted | needs $ recharge, not SKU switch |
| INSIGHTS | aliyun_b | `qwen3.6-flash` 403 | **`qwen-flash`** 200 | same root cause |
| INSIGHTS | aliyun_a | `qwen3.6-flash-2026-04-16` 403 | **`qwen3.5-flash`** 200 | A's flash version exhausted too |
| INSIGHTS | zhipu | `glm-4-plus` 429 | **`glm-4-flash`** 200 | same root cause |
| INSIGHTS | deepseek | `deepseek-v4-flash` 402 | unchanged | account exhausted |
| CHART | all | `glm-5` / `glm-5` / `glm-4.5-air` / `deepseek-v4-flash` | **unchanged** | primaries working |
| MAPPER | all | `qwen-turbo` / `qwen3.5-122b-a10b` / `glm-4.5-air` / `deepseek-v4-flash` | **unchanged** | primaries working |
| REASONING | all | `deepseek-r1` / `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` / `glm-4.5-air` / `deepseek-v4-pro` | **unchanged** | primaries working |
| VL | aliyun_b | `qwen-vl-plus-2025-05-07` 200 | unchanged | working |
| VL | aliyun_a | `qwen3-vl-flash` 403 | **`qwen-vl-plus-2025-05-07`** 200 | A's flash VL exhausted; reuse the working SKU id (DashScope compatible-mode lets both accounts call same SKU) |
| VL | zhipu | `glm-4.6v` (payload incompat per code comment) | unchanged | known broken — leave as-is, chain falls to deepseek (None, skip) |
| VL | deepseek | `None` | unchanged | no DeepSeek VL model |
| REVIEW | all | `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` / `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` / `glm-4.5-air` / `deepseek-v4-pro` | **unchanged** | primaries working |

**Summary**: 5 SKU changes across SLOT.CHAT (2), SLOT.INSIGHTS (3), SLOT.VL (1). 0 chain order changes. 0 circuit-breaker / timeout tuning changes.

## Live Audit Confirmation

This audit was run live against production API keys before commit. Results reproducible by running `/tmp/audit-llm.sh` with the keys from `scripts/systemd/restart-test.sh.new`. Re-audit recommended before EVERY SKU change in production routing.

---

## DeepSeek tail provider note

DeepSeek (the official non-DashScope account) is fully balance-exhausted across all SKUs. The chain still walks through but `_is_quota_exhausted` only matches 403/429 — **402 falls through to the "Other errors" branch which still continues to next provider**. So functionally the tail is a no-op. Re-audit after balance recharge.

Suggested follow-up (out of scope for this PR): treat 402 the same as 403/429 for cleaner error logs.

---

## Post-deploy verification

Within 5-10 min of `--env test` (then `--env prod`) deploy, watch:

```
journalctl -u cretas-python -f | grep -E '\[llm_router\]'
```

Expected: `[llm_router] slot=chat OK via aliyun_b/qwen-flash` log line appears, "All providers exhausted" error gone.

If still seeing exhaustion, re-run audit — quota status changes hour-to-hour as other systems consume.

## MO Merge — Steve Console Screenshot Audit (supersedes table above)

After the live probe (above) Steve provided console-screenshot evidence of additional SKUs whose free quota is **intact**, on the same prod-key accounts. Decision: build on the live-probe baseline + apply MO overrides where Steve's screenshot shows more headroom (`qwen-max` 1M, `qwen3.6-max-preview` 999K, etc.) or a cleaner pool (`glm-4.5-air` 6.5M independent — NOT in zhipu's depleted 通用池).

Steve confirmed the screenshot is from the same prod-key accounts as the live probe, so the un-probed SKUs are trusted (skip extra live-probe round). Final picks below.

### Final SLOT × Provider table (this is what ships)

Chain extended 4 → 5: `aliyun_b → aliyun_a → zhipu → aliyun_a_deepseek → deepseek`. The new entry `aliyun_a_deepseek` reuses aliyun_a's API key + DashScope endpoint but routes `deepseek-v4-pro` (DashScope-hosted, separate ~999K free pool).

| SLOT | aliyun_b | aliyun_a | zhipu | aliyun_a_deepseek (NEW) | deepseek (official) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CHAT | `qwen-max` (1M) | `qwen3.6-max-preview` (999K) | `glm-4.5-air` (6.5M pool) | `deepseek-v4-pro` (999K DashScope) | `deepseek-v4-pro` (paid, balance 0) |
| INSIGHTS | `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` (816K, live ✓) | `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` (998K) | `glm-4.5-air` | `deepseek-v4-pro` | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| CHART | `glm-5` (875K, live ✓) | `glm-5` (886K, live ✓) | `glm-4.5-air` | `deepseek-v4-pro` | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| MAPPER | `qwen3.5-122b-a10b` (998K) | `qwen3.5-122b-a10b` (998K, live ✓) | `glm-4.5-air` | `deepseek-v4-pro` | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| REASONING | `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` (974K) | `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` (998K, live ✓) | `glm-4.5-air` | `deepseek-v4-pro` | `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| VL | `qwen3-vl-plus-2025-12-19` (1M) | `qwen3-vl-plus-2025-12-19` (1M) | `glm-4.6v` (6M pool, payload incompat) | `None` (no DS VL) | `None` (no DS VL) |
| REVIEW (unchanged) | `deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b` | `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` | `glm-4.5-air` | `None` (skip) | `deepseek-v4-pro` |

### Deltas vs live-probe baseline (rows above this section)

| SLOT/Acct | Live-probe pick | Final (MO merge) pick | Why MO trumps |
|---|---|---|---|
| CHAT/aliyun_b | `qwen-flash` | `qwen-max` | Screenshot: 1M free intact; max-class quality preferred |
| CHAT/aliyun_a | `qwen3.5-plus-2026-04-20` | `qwen3.6-max-preview` | Screenshot: 999K free intact; newer max version |
| CHAT/zhipu | `glm-4-flash` | `glm-4.5-air` | Screenshot: 6.5M independent pool; better model |
| INSIGHTS/aliyun_b | `qwen-flash` | `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | Screenshot: 816K; better-suited for insight gen than flash |
| INSIGHTS/aliyun_a | `qwen3.5-flash` | `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` | Screenshot: 998K; consistency with B |
| INSIGHTS/zhipu | `glm-4-flash` | `glm-4.5-air` | Same 6.5M pool reason as CHAT |
| MAPPER/aliyun_b | `qwen-turbo` | `qwen3.5-122b-a10b` | Screenshot: 998K; consistency with A |
| REASONING/aliyun_b | `deepseek-r1` | `qwen3.5-397b-a17b` | Screenshot: 974K; consistency with A |
| VL/aliyun_b | `qwen-vl-plus-2025-05-07` | `qwen3-vl-plus-2025-12-19` | Screenshot: 1M; newer version |
| VL/aliyun_a | `qwen-vl-plus-2025-05-07` | `qwen3-vl-plus-2025-12-19` | Same as B |
| ALL non-VL/REVIEW + new column | (chain stopped at deepseek-official) | `aliyun_a_deepseek` inserted | Routes `deepseek-v4-pro` via DashScope free pool (999K) so chain doesn't dead-end at deepseek-official balance 0 |

### Avoided SKUs (per Steve audit)

- `qwen3.6-flash` on aliyun_b — 403 quota (live-probe confirmed)
- `qwen3.5-plus-2026-04-20` on aliyun_a — transient timeout (live-probe), MO picks newer max-preview as belt-and-suspenders
- `glm-4-plus` on zhipu — 429 (通用池 0 balance, live-probe confirmed; MO confirms by routing around the depleted pool)
- `deepseek-v4-flash` on deepseek-official — 402 (live-probe confirmed); MO swaps to `deepseek-v4-pro` for tail consistency even though both will 402 until balance recharged

### Post-deploy expected behavior

Look for these log lines in `journalctl -u cretas-python -f` after deploy:

```
[llm_router] slot=chat OK via aliyun_b/qwen-max
[llm_router] slot=insights OK via aliyun_b/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
[llm_router] slot=chart OK via aliyun_b/glm-5
[llm_router] slot=vl OK via aliyun_b/qwen3-vl-plus-2025-12-19
```

The previous `[llm_router] All providers exhausted for chat:` error should be gone. If a slot still exhausts B, the new chain walks A → zhipu → aliyun_a_deepseek → deepseek-official in order.

### Re-audit cadence

Free quota resets monthly per Aliyun's billing cycle. Re-run `/tmp/audit-llm.sh` style probe ~every 2 weeks, or whenever the "All providers exhausted" log line reappears, to catch SKUs that exhausted mid-month.
