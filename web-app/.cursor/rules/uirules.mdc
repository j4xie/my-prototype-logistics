### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use ‚Äúclass:‚Äù instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a ‚Äúhandle‚Äù prefix, like ‚ÄúhandleClick‚Äù for onClick and ‚ÄúhandleKeyDown‚Äù for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=‚Äú0‚Äù, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, ‚Äúconst toggle = () =>‚Äù. Also, define a type if possible.

UI Design System Guidelines
All generated UIs should follow a consistent "Neo Minimal iOS-Style Admin UI" design language across all screens.

Use the following design rules:

Layout
Set max-w-[390px] as the maximum width for content containers
Center the layout using mx-auto
Use flex flex-col min-h-screen as the outer page wrapper
Apply pt-[80px] to main content areas to avoid overlap with fixed top navigation
Apply pb-[80px] to main content if a fixed bottom tab bar is used
Top Navigation (Fixed)
Use fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-[999] bg-[#1890FF] text-white shadow-sm
Left: back icon and page title
Right: icon buttons (bell, settings, etc.), always spaced and clickable
Ensure navigation icons are not hidden or clipped by layout or overflow
Card Design
All content blocks must use: bg-white rounded-lg shadow-sm p-4
Typography:
Titles: text-lg font-medium text-gray-900
Subtext: text-sm text-gray-600
Use grid layouts where applicable, e.g. grid-cols-2 gap-4 for stats or quick actions
User Info Card
Include avatar, greeting (‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºåÂº†‰∏â), shift (e.g. Êó©Áè≠), and permission tag
Role tags: rounded-full text-xs bg-[#E6F7FF] text-[#1890FF] px-2 py-0.5
Stats Cards
Use icon blocks on the right with soft backgrounds (e.g. bg-icon-primary)
Highlight numbers with text-2xl font-medium text-gray-900
Colors: use text-[#FF4D4F] for warnings, #52C41A for success, etc.
Quick Actions
Layout in two columns: grid grid-cols-2 gap-4
Each button: vertically stacked icon + label
Backgrounds: bg-icon-success, bg-icon-warning, bg-icon-purple, etc.
Add hover:shadow-md and hover:scale-[1.03] for subtle feedback
If no permission, disable the button or gray it out; optionally show lock icon
Bottom Tab Bar
Use fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 bg-white border-t border-gray-200
Use flex justify-around layout
Tab item: vertical stack (icon + label), text-xs mt-1
Highlight active tab with text-[#1890FF] and optional indicator bar
Accessibility & Responsiveness
All interactive elements must support :hover, :focus, and :active states
Maintain mobile-first layout with adequate spacing and tap targets
Use descriptive aria-labels and semantic roles where appropriate
üí° Purpose: These rules ensure all pages look visually consistent, clean, and modern. They follow a mobile-first, admin-style system UI standard based on a minimalist, card-based layout.
