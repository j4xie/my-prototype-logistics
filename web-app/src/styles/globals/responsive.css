/*
 * Responsive Styles
 *
 * This file is intended for global responsive styles that cannot be easily achieved
 * with Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the components.
 * However, prefer using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) whenever possible.
 *
 * Standard breakpoints (from Tailwind default config):
 * sm: min-width: 640px
 * md: min-width: 768px
 * lg: min-width: 1024px
 * xl: min-width: 1280px
 * 2xl: min-width: 1536px
 *
 * Mobile-first approach is encouraged.

  /* Example: Ensure text is readable on all screen sizes */

/* Add any global responsive helper classes or overrides here if necessary */
