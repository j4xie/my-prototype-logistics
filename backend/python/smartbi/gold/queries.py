"""Gold read-path queries — downstream modules hit these instead of
recomputing aggregates on every request.

Week 4 Phase B v0 of Unified Data Layer v1 spec (§5).

Scope today
-----------
One query shape per downstream module that will eventually cut over to
Gold. Started with `finance_summary` (the spec's §5 pilot). The actual
Java cutover touches the existing FinanceAnalysisService and is deferred
to a future session — today's deliverable is the Python primitive that
the cutover will use (Python service) or replicate (Java JDBC).

All queries
-----------
- Accept `factory_id` + a date range
- Assume tenant_ctx is set so RLS on agg_* enforces tenant scope (the
  `factory_id` arg is belt-and-suspenders — it's also in the WHERE)
- Return plain dicts (not dataclasses) so they're JSON-serializable
  directly via FastAPI

Why not pydantic models
-----------------------
Keeping this layer dict-based because the shape will evolve rapidly
(v1.1 pilot → v1.2 more modules → v1.3 review adapters) and pydantic
versioning churn would create friction. The FastAPI route layer will
wrap these in response_model schemas as we lock shapes down.
