"""Dual-write hook for B Silver writers.

Per spec 04-C v1.3 §5.2: each B writer, after its main INSERT, optionally
calls write_provenance_for_fields() to record cell-level lineage. Gated by
SMARTBI_ENABLE_PROVENANCE env flag (default OFF until prod observation
confirms safety).

The hook uses resolve_conflict() so concurrent uploads of the same product/
field with different values either supersede correctly (priority-based) or
queue for admin review (30% diff). Writers always pass their canonical
source_type ('product_summary' / 'review' / 'bill_flow' / 'inventory') so the
priority chain works correctly.
