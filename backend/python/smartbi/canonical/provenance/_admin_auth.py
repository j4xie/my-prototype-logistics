"""Shared admin RBAC helper for the Sub-Project C provenance API surface.

P2-6 (post-D27 review extract): previously duplicated 30 lines between
``provenance_audit.py`` (Day 26) and ``factory_provenance_config.py``
(Day 27), with 1 line of error-message drift. Both call sites now route
here.

Auth model
----------
JWT auth populates ``request.state.{role,factory_id,auth_method}`` via
``backend/python/auth_middleware.py``. Admin-tier roles
(platform_admin / factory_super_admin / permission_admin) are allowed
through. Internal Java→Python calls (``auth_method=='internal'``) bypass
the role check but still benefit from the factory_id RLS filter
downstream.

Status code policy
------------------
- ``401`` when the request carries no auth state at all (middleware
  should have caught it; this is defense-in-depth).
- ``403`` when the role is present but not admin-tier.

Both messages are Chinese (P1-3 i18n consistency); the ``action_name``
parameter lets each caller customize which feature is being gated.
