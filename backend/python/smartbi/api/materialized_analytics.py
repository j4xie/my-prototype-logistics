"""API routes for materialized analytics cache.

GET /api/smartbi/analytics/cached/{upload_id}
  → Returns cached template results for the upload (factory-scoped).
  → Status 404 if upload not found.
  → Status 403 if factory_id mismatch (cross-tenant attempt).

POST /api/smartbi/analytics/materialize/{upload_id}
  → Triggers fresh materialization + persist. Idempotent (upserts).
  → Used by upload hook (Task 13) and manual refresh.

POST /api/smartbi/analytics/reclassify/{upload_id}  (γ-2)
  → Re-runs unified field_classifier on existing upload's columns,
    updates smart_bi_pg_field_definitions where classifications changed,
    then triggers re-materialization to regenerate cache with the new roles.
  → Used to fix historical uploads affected by buggy legacy classifiers
    (e.g. qhj upload 4169's 账单号/商品结账总数 misclassifications).
