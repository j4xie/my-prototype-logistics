"""LLM-answer cache for repeat queries — v4 B2-B (Apr 26 2026).

Background: S4 v4 audit showed 87% follow-ups go through LLM (~12s). Many are
repeat queries within 24h. Caching the LLM answer keyed by (factory_id +
normalized_query + upload_id) lets repeat callers get the answer in ~200ms.

Distinct from:
- ChatSession (parent answer summary for follow-up CONTEXT injection — different scope)
- materialized template cache (template-level, pre-computed at upload time)
- InsightCache (in-process LRU, lost on restart)

This is a SHA256-keyed PG-persistent cache surviving restarts. TTL 24h
matching narrative_cache pattern. Skipped when v2 conv memory has parent
context (different turn = different answer expected).
