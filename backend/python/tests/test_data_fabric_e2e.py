"""Data Fabric end-to-end integration tests against real test smartbi_db.

These tests are SKIPPED if PG is not reachable (default local-dev case) so the
default ``pytest tests/`` run keeps passing. To opt in:

    INTEGRATION_PG_DSN=postgresql://smartbi_user:smartbi_secure_password_2025@localhost:5432/smartbi_db \\
        python -m pytest tests/test_data_fabric_e2e.py -v

Why these exist (per code-reviewer note Apr 26 2026): the existing 138 unit
tests are ALL mock-based, so they cannot catch:
  - The Review writer idempotency bug (already fixed in ``bf7ea2675``)
  - RLS gaps if ``app.factory_id`` is unset (silent 0-row INSERTs under
    FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY)
  - COALESCE-based unique-index expression syntax errors
  - Real ON CONFLICT semantics on PostgreSQL 13

Each test pre-cleans + post-cleans its tenant rows. Tests run inside a
transaction so any rows that escape cleanup are rolled back. We use a
dedicated test factory_id (``F999_INTEGRATION``) to stay out of any real
tenant's data.
