"""Regression tests for #539 — SQL syntax errors in restaurant_ops_etl Gold templates.

Background:
  `_AGG_PRODUCT_COST_SQL` had `# noqa: E501` embedded inside the Python triple-quoted
  string. PostgreSQL received the literal text `# noqa: E501` as part of the SQL and
  errored with `syntax error at or near ":"` (the colon before `E501`). All
  `R_*_REAL` restaurant tenants failed Gold materialization in prod (single
  transaction in `materialize_gold_daily_ops` rolls back ALL 7 aggregations when
  the 7th — product_cost — fails).

Approach:
  - test_no_python_lint_markers_in_sql_constants: exact-bug regression — assert no
    `# noqa: ...` / `# type: ...` / `# TODO` etc. embedded in any module-level
    `_AGG_*_SQL` constant.
  - test_no_lone_colons_in_agg_sql_constants: broader class — PostgreSQL `:` is only
    valid as part of `::` (cast) or `:=` (assign). Lone `:` in raw SQL = syntax
    error. Catches this bug AND any future variant (e.g. someone pastes a docstring
    snippet with a colon).
  - test_no_pound_chars_in_agg_sql_constants: another angle — `#` is not a SQL
    comment character. Any `#` in the SQL is suspicious (likely Python comment leak).

  Each test imports the actual module constants — so the test is locked to the
  shipped code path. CI failure = bug shipped.
